# Project Flogo Implementation for CatalystML

## Overview of Specification
CatalystML is a language agnostic specification aimed at facilitating data transformations.  The initiating use-case being transforming incoming data into a form for a 1-to-1 input into a Machine Learning (ML) model.  Refer to the [CatalystML specification](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/catalystml) for specifics around the specification, supported operations, etc.

## Flogo/Golang implementation
This repository containeds an implementation of CatalystML for [Flogo](flogo.io) written in [Golang](https://golang.org/).  With relatively minor context switching it can also be used as a Golang implementation.  The documents included within this repository detail the choices that were made when creating this implementation as well as any deviations from the specification itself (primarily things yet to be implemented). 

Within Flogo this specification is implementated
